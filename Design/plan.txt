GL:
	- Drawing Arcs / circles
		- Inside the circle will be pixelated!
	- Background
	- Circle Placement Algorithm for different screen sizes
	- Hovering over circles to make them bigger, and showing / positioning text over them.
	- Clicking and making everything else fade out and then expanding the circle.
HTML/CSS:
	- Formatting the layout of the inner pages / picking fonts and stuff.
	- Doing the clicky SVGs and animating them.
	- Creating sub pages for the projects (fade out the elms on the page, and fade in the ones relating to the projects?)
	- Audio Equalizer
